A Harvard Medical School graduate takes a position at a mental institution and soon becomes obsessed with a female mental patient, but he has no idea of a recent and horrifying staffing change. The Call director Brad Anderson returns to the helm for this psychological thriller loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 short story The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, and centered on the experiences of a Harvard Medical School graduate (Jim Sturgess) who becomes obsessed with a mental patient named Eliza Graves (Kate Beckinsale) while working at a mental asylum that's been taken over by the inmates.
