Italia 90 was another fascinating tournament, a melting pot of different styles, culture and technique. The biggest tournament to date, it saw the emergence of the African nations with the free-flowing Cameroon capturing everyone's hearts. The final was tight and not for the squeamish, but the well-drilled and better-disciplined Germans prevailed 1-0 winners to claim the crown for the third time.
