Donald, the world's most loveable duck from Walt Disney gets a DVD all about his web-footed, quacking white-feathered silly self. He's irritated by a bee in "The Inferior Decorator," and he gets to show off his dance moves with a lady-friend in "Mr Duck Steps Out." A funny and duck-filled cartoon compilation.
