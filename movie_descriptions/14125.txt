Jennifer (Elisha Cuthbert), a model, is on top of the world. Her highly sought-after image adorns magazine covers and billboards. When she is alone at a charity event, she is abducted and put into a cell with another prisoner (David Gillies). Their captor subjects the two to torture, and they must find a way out of the chamber of horrors before he kills them.
