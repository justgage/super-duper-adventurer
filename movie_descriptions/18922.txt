A seductive femme fatale (Monica Bellucci) and two con men -- one cool as ice, and one who just likes to "ice" his victims -- enlist a mild-mannered, unsuspecting man in their mission to steal a rare and valuable fish. They plan to sell it back to its grieving owner at an enormous profit (talk about "sleeping with the fishes!"). Tcheky Karyo, Michel Muller and Dominique Pinon co-star.
