In this sequel to the hit comedy Meet the Parents, hard-to-crack ex-CIA man Jack Byrnes and his wife, Dina, head for the warmer climes of Florida to meet son-in-law-to-be Greg Focker's mom and dad, Bernie and Roz. Unlike their happily matched offspring, the future in-laws find themselves in a situation of opposites that definitely do not attract.
