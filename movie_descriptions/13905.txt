60 days on and Rygel is retrieving pieces of John and Aeryn from the sea bed. The diagnosan (Season of Death) re-crystalises them and they start getting to know the species that live on that world. Meanwhile, Scorpius and Sikozu are aboard a Peacekeeper Command Carrier on a recon mission. They attack a Scarren ship which provokes the Scarrens into declaring war on The Peacekeepers.
