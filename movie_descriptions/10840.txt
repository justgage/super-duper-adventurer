This animated short by Miyazaki was created as a music video for the song "On Your Mark" by Japanese duo Chage &amp; Aska. The narrative is non-linear with no dialog and loosely follws the song lyrics and chorus. The video feels like a very compressed version of an epic Miyazaki film. The story follows two police men in a futuristic setting in their repeated attempts at rescuing a mysterious winged girl.
