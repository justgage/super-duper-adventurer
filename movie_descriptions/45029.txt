Cult auteur Andy Sidaris delivers another B-movie spectacular in this offering from the Triple B (short for bullets, bombs and babes) Collection. In Fit to Kill, buxom do-gooders Donna (Dona Speir) and Nicole (Roberta Vasquez) set out to reclaim the stolen Alexa diamond from its hiding place in Russia â€¦ only to run into their nemesis, Martin Kane (Geoffrey Moore). Bruce Penhall, Tony Peck and Cynthia Brimhall co-star.
