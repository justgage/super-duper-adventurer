The original American Pie characters have moved on, except for Sherman and Jim Levenstein's still understanding dad. Steve Stifler's little brother Matt wants to join his brother's business (the hit it big Girls Gone Wild) and after everything Matt has heard from Jim's band-geek wife Michelle, he plans to go back to band camp and make a video of his own: Bandies Gone Wild!
