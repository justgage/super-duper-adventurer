The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life---so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think.
