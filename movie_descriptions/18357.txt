Based on an attraction at Disneyland, the Country Bear Jamboree, "The Country Bears" is one in a long line of live action Disney family films. A satirical, behind-the-music look at rock &amp; roll bands. Beary, a young bear raised by a human family in a world where humans and talking bears coexist, attempts to trace his roots. He meets up with the Country Bears, a long-since broken-up band.
