This lavish small-screen adaptation of Homer's ancient epic--replete with exotic Maltese and Turkish locations, state-of-the-art special effects, and many bronzed muscles gleaming with sweat--chronicles the voyage home of a Trojan hero, Odysseus, and includes many more scenes of his faithful, beautiful wife dodging leering suitors at home than Homer ever composed.
