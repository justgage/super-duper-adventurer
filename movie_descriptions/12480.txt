The film is based on a German play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Tropfen auf heisse Steine. A 50-year-old business man Léopold arrives home with 20-year-old Franz, whom he has just met. Franz is not quite sure why he agreed to come home with Léopold as he is supposed to be meeting his fiancée Anna, but he accepts drinks from Léopold and they begin to get to know each other.
