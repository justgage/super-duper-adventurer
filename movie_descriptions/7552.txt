After losing their high-paying corporate jobs, Jane and Dick Harper (Jim Carrey and TÃ©a Leoni) turn to robbing banks to maintain their upwardly mobile standard of living in this action-comedy based on the 1977 film of the same name. The couple's hold-up act begins as a desperate measure. But before long, they're actually enjoying it -- and now it's getting to be a habit.
