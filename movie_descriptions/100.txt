A fast paced comedy about a card sharp and his unwillingly enlisted friends, who need to make a lot of cash quick after losing a sketchy poker match. To do this they decide to pull a heist on a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door. Lots of British humor, off the wall characters, and a line up of unbelievable scenes put director Guy Ritchie on the map.
