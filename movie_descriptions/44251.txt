The film opens with a Saiyan Space pod flying through space and crash-landing on Earth out of which a wounded Saiyan crawls out: Broly, the Legendary Super Saiyan. The wounded Broly shouts out in frustation and turns into normal form. The place soon freezes, trapping him in it and he falls into a coma.
