In 1904 a Russian woman named Sabina Spielrein arrives at Carl Jung's clinic, seeking treatment for hysteria. Jung is eager to test Sigmund Freud's theories on Sabina and, in fact, successfully treats her. Two years later Jung and Sabina meet Freud in person, and Jung takes over the treatment of Otto Gross, whose influence leads Jung to begin an affair with Sabina, contributing to a rift with Freud.
