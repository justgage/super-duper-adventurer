We go on vacation to Margate with the van Tonder Family. Hendrik wants to go fishing, the kids swim and play Yollie and Maggie wants to sunbathe and Ouboet has a self built modded speedboat (Spuitpoep II) which he wants to test out at sea. Their dream vacation gets sabotaged by a Joburg company, who wants to buy the caravan park where they are vacationing to demolish it and build a shopping mall. But then they get to deal with the van Tonders who doesn't let anyone mess with them. Hillarious from beginning to end.
