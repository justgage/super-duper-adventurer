The third installment in the Mummy franchise takes archaeologist Rick O'Connell to China, pitting him against an emperor from the 2,000-year-old Han dynasty who's returned from the dead to pursue a quest for world domination. This time, O'Connell enlists the help of his family -- including his wife and son -- to quash the so-called Dragon Emperor and his abuse of supernatural power.
